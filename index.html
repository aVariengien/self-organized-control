	<h2 class="margin-m"> Introduction </h2>
		<p>
			One of the most incredible feat of life could be the development of the complexity of a human brain from a single cell.
			<!-- trying to tackle gave the sense that it was completely unsuccessful  -->
			The field of neurodevelopment has been working on this problem for decades. These studies lead to the discovery of intricate mechanisms where gradients of chemicals
			and local cell interaction shaped
			the differentiation of pre-neural cells and the organization of their connections. [<b> citation needed</b>]
		</p>
		<p>
			Even after the brain is considered fully grown, this process does not stop. New neurons are formed every second until
			death, and the shape and the importance of their connections always change.[<b> citation needed</b>] This neural plasticity is led by 
			the sensory inputs received by the individual and seems to be at the root of the emergence of intelligence. 
			In addition to the ability to cope with a changing environment, this plasticity provides an incredible robustness. 
			For instance, the processing of visual information can be deferred to the auditive cortex if the first is impaired. [<b> citation needed</b>]
		</p>
		<p>
			The neural plasticity can be thought as part of the whole biological mechanism directed toward homeostasis of both
			shape and function.
			This conceptual proximity is also justified by biological evidence like the recent discovery of the role of electrical 
			activity during morphogenesis. 
			The same ion channels are used both for local communication between non neural cells during embryogenesis and 
			in the neurons to carry action potentials. [<b> Mike Levin et al. on flatworms</b>]
			More generally, it seems to exists
			a continuum between the phenomena we usually call <i> growing</i>, <i> learning</i> and <i>computing</i>. 
			Each of these abilities seems be a different aspect of the same underlying self-organizing system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Moreover, it seems that the DNA doesn't encode precise details of the neural network.
			There is an information gap between the size of the DNA and the complexity of 
			the neural network that has been previously called <i>genomic bottleneck</i> [<b>A critique of pure learning ..., Anthony M. Zador</b>]. 
			The DNA, through the shape of the proteins it encodes, specifies the local behavior of cells. The neural network is then a structure 
			that emerges through these local interactions and yield a useful biological processing of the inputs received by the senses. [<b>The Challenge Of Complexity, Wolfgang Banzhaf</b>]
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Despite the crucial role of growth in the emergence of intelligence, modern advances on artificial neural networks mainly 
			focused on the handcrafted design of static map
			neural connection. During the phase called <i>learning</i> - that is in fact quite far from the biological sense of this 
			word [<b>A critique of pure learning ..., Anthony M. Zador</b>]- the connections of this architecture are optimized to 
			reduce the error on the task to solve. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Some effort has been made to include an automatic way to incrementally design neural network architectures. These techniques include
			the use of genetic algorithms [<b>citation</b>], pruning of connection [<b>citation</b>] or with the introduction
			of Growing Neural Networks. [<b>Growing Artificial Neural Networks, John Mixter and Ali Akoglu</b>]
			Nonetheless, in these works the process is a tool of navigating the topological parameter space, rather then treating the learning as a developmental problem.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this work we attempt at bridging the gap between growth and computation by using neural cellular automaton (CA) [<b>Growing NCA</b>].
			This is a spatially distributed system composed of cells that interact through local interaction. Their update rule consists in 
			an artificial neural networks and thus can be optimized through
			the classical and efficient gradient descent-based techniques. 
			Even if the learning process is still happening through a procedure exterior to the system, the local rules encodes both
			the developmental process - the transformation from a random grid to a configuration suitable for computation- and the
			information processing itself. 
			We found that the cells were able to transmit and combine in a meaningful way the information from input cells to output cells 
			used as a readout.
			The system demonstrates long-term stability and robustness to noise and damage. 
			We illustrate these abilities on a simple control task as a proof of concept.

	<h2> The pole balancing task </h2>
		
		<p>
		The cart-pole problem is a commonly used toy problem in the reinforcement learning community. In this
		environment, an agent can observe the pole angle and angular velocity, the cart position, and its linear velocity.
		Based on these observations, it must decide whether to apply a force on the left or the right of the cart in order
		to maximize the time spent with the pole on the top.
		
		We chose this problem because of its low number of input and output that enables us to
		use a small-sized grid and an easy experimentation environment.
		</p>

	<h2> Cell state </h2>
		<p>
			There are 3 types of cells in a grid: the normal cells, the input, and output cells.
		</p>
		<p>
			The state of each cell is composed of 6 channels. The first is the <i> information channel</i> where meaningful
			input and output information transit. The second is identifying the inputs: it is equal to 1 in the input cell, 0 elsewhere.
			The third is similar for the outputs. The last three are hidden channels.
		</p>
		<p>
			The state of the input cell cannot be changed, the information channel is set to the value to input at this cell
			and the other channel expects the output identifier is set to 1.
			
			The values of the information channel of the output cells are used as the output of the system to be optimized
			to solve the task.
		</p>

		<h4> Cell position </h4>
		<p>
			For this task, we use redundancy in the inputs: each of the 4 physical observations of the environment is linked to 2 input cells.
			We thought it could improve the opportunity for information combination and robustness.
		</p>
		<p>
			The 8 inputs are arranged in an octagonal shape (dotted line) with the two outputs being offset by 2 cells from the center of the octagon.
			We chose this configuration to ensure an equal distribution of the distance between each input information and output.

	<h2> Model </h2>
		<p>
		Except the states, the neural CA architecture we used is similar to the one described here. [<b>Self-classifying MNIST Digits</b>]
		The perception layer is composed of 20 learnable 3x3 filters, and the single hidden layers counts 30 units.
		In total our model has 1854 learnable parameters.
		</p>
	<h2> Training procedure </h2>
		<p>
		Our model can be abstracted as a black box function that takes inputs (that will be fed to the information channel of input cells)
		and transform them in outputs (the information channel of output cells). This function is differentiable with respect to its
		parameters and thus they can be optimized as it's usually done for any common machine learning model.
		
		To tackle the cart-pole problem, we used Deep Q-learning [<b>citation</b>] where the usual artificial neural network is seamlessly replace by the neural CA.
		</p>
		<h4> Loss function </h4>
			<p>
			The loss function for the task is the L2 loss between the output and the target.
			To achieve long term stability and we added a penalty for 
			cells that have channels value out of bound [-5,5].
			
			<b> Add a formula </b>
			</p>
		<h4>Model initialization </h4>
			<p>
				We found that when trained directly the model was stuck in a local minimum where it outputted constant values, no matter
				the state of the inputs.
				We think that this is due to the fact that the intermediate cells between inputs lead to a vanishing to the gradient as
				in vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks.
			</p>
			<p>
				To solve this problem, we first optimize the neural CA for an easier task: 
				both outputs were optimized to compute the mean of the inputs. 
				We found that it was able to learn with a reasonably low error after several thousand learning steps.
			</p>
			<p>
				This initialization enables the neural CA to learn to make an information link 
				from input to output and to stabilize the state of the cells.
			</p>
		<h4> Robustness </h4>
			<p>
				To learn to recover from damage, before each learning step the grid has 0.5 probability of receiving damage.
				
				A damage consist in the states of the cells in a circle of the grid replaced by uniform random values in [-1,1], as shown
				in black below. Note that a damage impact all channel that can be changed and that input are not affected by damage while outputs are.

	<h2> Results </h2>
	
	Our model was able to solve the cartpole problem and achieve long-term stability of both
	the pole balancing and of the state of the CA.
	It was able to balance the pole for more than 10k simulation steps. A video of 9 independent
	runs for 1000 simulation steps is shown below.
