	<h2 class="margin-m"> Introduction </h2>
		<p>
			One of the most remarkable feats of life is the developmental process leading to the emergent complexity of the human brain from 
			a single cell. The field of neurodevelopment (i.e., the development of the nervous system) has been investigating this problem for 
			decades. These studies led to the discovery of the intricate mechanisms by which gradients of chemicals and local cell interactions
			shape the differentiation of pre-neural cells and the organization of their connections. [<b> citation needed</b>]
		</p>
		<p>
			Even after the brain is considered fully grown, its developmental process does not stop. New neurons are formed 
			continuously until death, and the shape and the strength of their connections change.[<b> citation needed</b>] 
			Such neural plasticity is influenced by the sensory inputs received by the individual and is considered to be 
			at the root of the emergence of intelligence. In addition to the ability to cope with a changing environment, 
			plasticity provides a remarkable robustness. For example, the processing of visual information can be deferred 
			to the auditive cortex if the first is impaired. [<b> citation needed</b>]
		</p>
		<p>
			The neural plasticity can be considered as a part of the whole biological mechanism governing homeostasis of both 
			shape and function. This conceptual proximity is also justified by biological evidence such as the recent discovery 
			of the role of electrical activity during morphogenesis. In particular, the same ion channels are used both for local 
			communication between non neural cells during embryogenesis and in the neurons to carry action potentials. [<b> Mike Levin et al. on flatworms</b>]
			More generally, there seems to exists a continuum between the phenomena we usually call <i> growing</i>, 
			<i> learning</i> and <i>computing</i>. 
			Each of these abilities may be considered a different aspect of the same underlying self-organizing system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Moreover, there is evidence that the DNA does not encode precise details of the resulting neural network. 
			There is an information gap between the size of the DNA and the complexity of the neural network, generally 
			referred to as <i>genomic bottleneck</i> [<b>A critique of pure learning ..., Anthony M. Zador</b>]. 
			The DNA, through the shape of the proteins it encodes, specifies the local behavior of cells. The neural 
			network is then a structure that emerges through these local interactions and yields a useful biological 
			processing of the inputs received by the senses. [<b>The Challenge Of Complexity, Wolfgang Banzhaf</b>]
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Despite the crucial role of growth in the emergence of intelligence, modern advances in artificial neural 
			networks mainly focus on the handcrafted design of static map neural connections. During the phase 
			called<i>learning</i>—that is in fact quite far from the biological sense of this 
			word [<b>A critique of pure learning ..., Anthony M. Zador</b>]—the connections of this architecture are 
			optimized to reduce the error on the task to solve.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Some effort has been made to include an automatic process to incrementally design neural network architectures. 
			These techniques include the use of genetic algorithms <b>[citation NEAT]</b>, pruning of connection 
			<b>[citation https://medvet.inginf.units.it/publications/2021-c-nmpzn-effects/]</b> or with the introduction of Growing Neural Networks. 
			<b>[https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal2020/32/473/98437, Growing Artificial Neural Networks, John Mixter and Ali Akoglu] </b>
			Nonetheless, in these works the process is a tool of navigating the topological parameter space, rather then treating the learning 
			as a developmental problem.
		</p>

		<p>
			 In this work, we attempt at bridging the gap between growth and computation by using neural cellular automaton (CA) 
			 <b>[Growing NCA, https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147570059.pdf]</b>. This is a spatially distributed system composed of 
			 cells that interact through local interaction. Their update rule consists of an artificial neural network and thus 
			 can be optimized through classical and efficient gradient descent-based techniques. Even if the learning process 
			 is still happening through a procedure exterior to the system, the local rules encode both the developmental 
			 process—the transformation from a random grid to a configuration suitable for computation—and the information processing itself. 
			 We found that the cells were able to transmit and combine in a meaningful way the information from input cells to output cells 
			 used as a readout. The system demonstrates long-term stability and robustness to noise and damage. We illustrate these 
			 abilities on a simple control task as a proof of concept.
		</p>
		
	<h2> The pole balancing task </h2>
		
		<p>
			The cart-pole problem is a commonly used toy problem in the reinforcement learning community. In this
			environment, an agent can observe the pole angle and angular velocity, the cart position, and its linear velocity.
			Based on these observations, it must decide whether to apply a force on the left or the right of the cart in order
			to maximize the time spent with the pole on the top.
			
			We chose this problem because of its low number of input and output that enables us to
			use a small-sized grid and an easy experimentation environment.
		</p>

	<h2> Cell state </h2>
		<p>
			There are 3 types of cells in a grid: the intermediate cells, the input, and output cells.
		</p>
		<p>
			The state of each cell is composed of 6 channels. The first is the <i> information channel</i> where meaningful
			input and output information transit. The second is identifying the inputs: it is equal to 1 in the input cell, 0 elsewhere.
			The third is similar for the outputs. The last three are hidden channels.
		</p>
		<p>
			The state of the input cell cannot be changed, the information channel is set to the value to input at this cell
			and the other channel expects the output identifier is set to 1.
			The values of the information channel of the output cells are used as the output of the system to be optimized
			to solve the task.
		</p>
		<p>
			The meaning of each channel and the different type of cell are represented in the figure below.
		</p>
			<div>
			<img src = "img/cell_states.png" width="700" class="center" >
			</div>
			<div class="caption">The role of the different channel and type of cells. Channel values that 
				are fixed are represented in red and in black are channels values that can be modified by the update rule.
				All the channels are used as input of the update rule.</div>

		<h4> Input encoding </h4>
			<p>
				For this task, we use redundancy in the inputs: each of the 4 physical observations of the environment is linked to 2 input cells.
				We thought it could improve the opportunity for information combination and robustness. 
				Note that the type of information contained in the input is not directly provided. To know which observation 
				each input cell encodes must be recover from the spatial position of the inputs or from the value of the information channel.
			</p>
			<p>
				The value of each observation is scaled by a constant factor before being transmitted to the input cell. The choice of the 
				factor corresponding to each observation was chosen to get similar ranges of values as input for the CA.
			</p>
		<h4> Cell position </h4>
		<p>
			The 8 inputs are arranged in an octagonal shape (dotted line) with the two outputs being offset by 2 cells from the center of the octagon.
			We chose this configuration to ensure an equal distribution of the distance between each input information and output.
			<div>
			<img src = "img/io_position.png" width="300" class="center" >
			</div>
			<div class="caption">The position of input (in red) and output cells (in yellow).</div>
			
		</p>
	
	<h2> Model </h2>
		<p>
			Except the design of the cell states, the neural CA architecture we used is similar to the one described here. [<b>Self-classifying MNIST Digits</b>]
			The perception layer is composed of 20 learnable 3x3 filters, and the single hidden layers counts 30 units.
			In total our model has 1854 learnable parameters.
		</p>
	<h2> Training procedure </h2>
		<p>
		Our model can be abstracted as a black box function that takes inputs (that will be fed to the information channel of input cells)
		and transform them in outputs (the information channel of output cells). This function is differentiable with respect to its
		parameters (the neural network used as update rule) and thus they can be optimized with classical gradient descent techniques.
		In this case we used the Adam optimized provided by the TensorFlow library. 
		
		
		</p>
		<h4> Algorithm </h4>
		<p>
			To tackle the cart-pole problem, we used Deep Q-learning [<b>citation</b>] where the usual artificial neural network is seamlessly replaced by the neural CA.
			The deep Q-learning algorithm aims at learning an estimate of the expected reward given a state and an action.
			More precisely, the value to be learned at a given step is:
			
			<div><img src = "img/q_value.png" width="70%" class="center"  ></div>
			<div class="caption">s<sub>t</sub> is the current state and a<sub>t</sub> the action to evaluate. 
				&gamma; is a discount factor. </div> <!-- We used &gamma;=0.95, a usual value for deep Q-learning. -->
			To keep the CA value for the information channel in range coherent with the other cells, we scale the outputs of the CA by a factor
			of 100 to get the Q-value estimates.
		</p>
		<h4> Environment </h4>
		<p>
			We used the cartpole environment provided by the <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI gym library</a>.
			<!-- comment on the custom reward function ? -->
		</p>
		<h4> Loss function </h4>
			<p>
			The loss function for the task is the L2 loss between the output and the target.
			To achieve long term stability and we added a penalty for 
			cells that have channels value out of bound [-5,5]. Note that excepted this overflow condition,
			the states of the intermediate cells are not directly optimized, they are free to evolve insofar as the outputs
			are correct.
			
			<div><img src = "img/loss_formula.png" width="100%" class="center"  ></div>
			<div class="caption">N is the size of the grid, &lambda; a parameter to control the amount of overflow penalty.</div>


			</p>
		<h4> Neural CA training </h4>
			<p>
				As introduced in [<b> Growing NCA </b>] we used pool sampling for the state of the neural CA during training.
				We let the CA evolves for a random number from 50 to 60 steps between the update of the input values and the readout of
				the outputs.
			</p>
		
		
		<h4>Model initialization </h4>
			<p>
				We found that when trained directly the model was trapped in a local minimum where it outputted constant values, no matter
				the state of the inputs.
				We think that this is due to the fact that there needs to be iterated application of the update rule on each of the cells between the inputs and outputs
				to transmit and modify the information.
				This repeated use of a neural network makes the gradient vanish, as observed
				in vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks.[<b> citation on the gradient vanishing problem </b>]
			</p>
			<p>
				To solve this problem, we first optimize the neural CA for an easier task: 
				both outputs were optimized to compute the mean of the inputs. 
				We found that it was able to learn with a reasonably low error after several thousand learning steps.
			</p>
			<p>
				This initialization enables the neural CA to learn to stabilize the state of the cells, make an information link 
				from input to output, and an primitive combination of the input values at the output cells. This procedure 
				is similar to what is used in curriculum learning where an easy subset of the task is learned before tackling the whole problem.
				Here we didn't used a sub-task as a starting point but a different task that shared common requirement.
			</p>
		<h4> Robustness </h4>
			<h6> Damage </h6>
			<p>
				To learn to recover from damage, before each learning step the grid has a 0.5 probability of receiving damage.
				
				A damage consist in the states of the cells in a circle of the grid replaced by uniform random values in [-1,1], as shown
				in black below. Note that a damage impact all the channels that can be modified and that inputs are not affected by damage while outputs are.
				<div><img src="img/damage.png" width="500" class="center" ></div>
				<div class="caption">
					A damage shown on the information channel. The shape of the damage is an irregular circle due to rasterization effect.
				</div>
			</p>
			<h6> Noise </h6>
			<p>
				Before applying each update, we added a uniform noise. Following what was done in [<b> self classifying MNIST</b>], 
				we used noisy update to force a long-term stabilization of the
				states of the CA. <!-- since it would learn to cope with perturbation at every step.-->
			</p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p>
	We ran the training procedure for around 200k gradient descent steps and several hundreds of environment simulations. Note
	that the hyperparameters for the training were not optimized and we mainly aimed at solving the task, not efficiency.
	</p>
	
	<h4> From estimating Q-values to stable behavior </h4>
	<p>
		To get a persistent control of the 
		cartpole agent, we begin by transmitting the observation of the current state in the input cells. We let the 
		neural CA evolve for a random number of steps between 50 and 60. We take the action
		corresponding to the maximum output value and we input the new observation to the neural CA.
		
		The grid is initialized with uniform random values and then same grid is used during the whole
		simulation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Our model was able to solve the cartpole problem and achieve long-term stability of both
		the pole balancing and of the states of the CA.
		It was able to balance the pole for more than 10k simulation steps. A video of 9 independent
		runs for 1000 simulation steps is shown below.

		</div>

		<div class="caption">9 independent runs of 1000 steps of the final model. For these runs, the neural CA is not perturbed by noise nor damage. </div>
	</p>
	
	<h4> Resulting neural CA </h4>
	<p>
		Beyond performance, it is interesting to visualize the activities of the 
		neural CA during the control of the cartpole agent. 
	</p>
		
		
		<div>
		<video controls width="750" class="center">

		<div class="caption">
			On the left, the states of the neural CA. 
			For the information channel, negative values are in blue, positive in red. <br>
			Bottom right: the plot of the output values of the neural CA. The vertical dotted lines note when 
			the action that has the maximum expected reward is taken in the cartpole environment.<br>
			Green triangle: LEFT action, orange triangle: RIGHT action.
		</div>
		<p>
			We observe that the first 50 steps lead to a precise spatial organization of the grid. 
			Once stabilized, this global shape will not change during the whole run. This can be thought
			as the developmental part of the neural CA.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then during the remaining part of the simulation, the spatial activity is changing in phase with 
			the physical observations. Note that the output values are always really
			close one. Since the pole is in a balanced state, the difference
			between the expected reward after going left or right is small. Going left then right or going right 
			then left will not yield a great difference in reward. 
		</p>
	<h4> Robustness abilities </h4>
	
	<p>
		During training, the neural CA has always at least 50 steps between the update of the inputs, where damage
		can occur,
		and the readout of the output values.
		During testing, we also experimented with a more challenging type of damage
		we called <i>uniformly distributed damage</i> where at each CA steps the grid has a constant
		probability of being damaged.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because this type of damage was more difficult to cope with, we decrease the damage frequency: 
		on average, the CA receive one damage every 4 input updates with uniformly distributed damage
		and one every 2 input updates with the damage used during training.
	</p>
	<p>
		The performance of the neural CA with different perturbation is summarized in the table below.
		The score denote the number of environment steps before the pole fall or the cart hit a wall.
		In each situation, we computed the mean score on 100 independent runs as well as the standard deviation.

	<h6> Resistance to damage </h6>
	
	<p>
	We found that the neural CA was able to maintain its shape and its function despite
	frequent damage. In the video above we can observe how the grid recover from damage.
	Although damage can lead to great perturbations in the output values and so to
	random actions, the agent is still able to stabilize the pole for several hundred steps.
	</p>
	<p>
	Moreover, the neural CA was not trained to recover from uniformly distributed damage, this explains
	the greater diminution in the average score shown in the table.

	<div class="caption">
		A neural CA controls a cartpole agent for 500 steps and recovers from grid damages.
		The frequency of damage is on average once every 18 cartpole steps except for the

		Damages can be seen around the steps 90 and 110. <br>
		We can observe important drops in the outputs after a damage during the
		time the CA recover.
	</div>
	
	</p>
		Here is an overview of the behavior of the cartpole agent when it receive uniformly distributed damages.
		We observe a great discrepancy of balancing abilities, as suggested by the important standard deviation
		in the table above.

	</p>
	
	<h6> Resistance to noise </h6>
	
	<p>
	The amount of noise added to each update is often similar to the difference between the two outputs when the
	pole is in a balanced state. This is why we observe in the video below the green and orange curves
	subject to stochastic variations that lead them to cross many times between each readout. The policy 
	that controls the cartpole agent is thus heavily randomized. Despite the noisy update, the neural CA can produce a probability distribution of actions such that a stable behavior emerges.

	<h6> Resistance to input deletion </h6>
	<p>
	One of the particularities of this neural CA model is its flexibility. For instance, the number of inputs and
		outputs can vary without changing the architecture. We only have to replace input or output cells with intermediate ones.
	</p>
	<p>
		We were interested in exploring this flexibility and whether our model showed robustness to input deletion.
		Because observation from the cartpole environment are encoded redundantly, we tested if it was able 
		to exploit this particularity even if it was not trained for this.
	
	</p>
	<p>
		In the video below, we can observe the consequences of deleting each input. Each column correspond to one observation type,
		each row corresponds to the first or the second input cell encoding this observation being deleted.

						  The CA are perturbed with uniformly distributed damage (on average one every 4 cartpole steps) and noisy update </div>
	
	<p>
		The system seems to be dependent on a few inputs that seriously impairs performances such as the second input encoding for pole angle and angular velocity, 
		while others seem not to affect significantly its abilities. We hypothesize that even if it has not been directly trained to be robust to input deletion,
		the robustness to damage and noise includes also adaptation to unseen perturbation.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Discussion </h2>
		<p>
			In this work, we demonstrated that neural CA can be used as a differentiable black-box function
			in the context of Deep-Q learning. We used it to solve the simple cartpole problem. A future challenge
			would be to apply it in cases where the input and output dimensionality is much higher.
		</p>
		<p>
			The computing abilities of the CA were maintained over several hundreds of 
			thousand iterations, producing an emergent stable behavior in the environment it controls for thousands of steps. 
			Moreover the system obtained demonstrated life-like phenomena such as a developmental phase, regeneration after damage,
			stability despite a noisy environment and robustness to unseen disruption such as input deletion.
			We can imagine that these abilities could be useful in a decentralized hardware where each cell is 
			processed by an independent computing unit.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a step toward designing intelligent systems that incorporate 
			self-organization abilities that are for now reserved to the living world.
		</p>
		
	<h2> Additional experiments </h2>
		In addition to the cartpole balancing problem, we explored other task and different variation of the neural CA model.
		Here is a short list of the other tasks we tried that relates to problems solved in a decentralized way
		by biological organisms.
		
		<ul>
			<li> Exploring an environment to find an output cell </li>
			<li> Following a gradient </li>
			<li> Computing boolean functions </li>
