Follow a Gradient
-------


This task is similar to the precedent but we provide an information for
the position of the output. Each cell possesses a read-only channel that 
is proportional to the distance to the target. This way, the growth 
can be directed toward the target cell instead of being limited to strategies of random
exploration of the grid.

In the video we observe a phase of growth to reach the target cell and then
a phase where growth is contained to limit the amount of energy used.

It's interesting to observe the cells creating a "casing" around living cells next to
the input and target to contain "leaks" that will spent energy.
